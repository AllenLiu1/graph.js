js-graph [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mhelvens/js-graph.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mhelvens/js-graph)
========

`js-graph` is a javascript library for storing arbitrary data in mathematical (di)graphs,
as well as traversing and analyzing them in various ways.

The library is fully functional and fully tested, but not yet documented. The tests in
the `spec` directory can be used, of course, but proper API documentation is also
forthcoming.
