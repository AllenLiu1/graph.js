`js-graph` is a javascript library for storing arbitrary data in mathematical (di)graphs,
as well as traversing and analyzing them in various ways. It was originally created to
track dependencies between options and modules. It is written in ECMAScript 6, but
auto-generated ECMAScript 5 versions are shipped with it.

If you want to run this library in an ECMAScript 5 context, it depends on the [Babel ES6 polyfill](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/polyfill/).
For your convenience, a version is provided with this polyfill already baked in, but you also
have the option of providing it yourself.

Feedback of any kind (questions, issues, pull requests) is greatly appreciated.


Files
-----

The `dist` directory offers different files for use in different circumstances.
Use the following table to determine which file to use in your situation.

| File                                          | Description                                                                                 |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `js‑graph.es6.js`                             | for use in an ECMAScript 6 context, e.g., a modern browser or transpiler                    |
| `js‑graph.js`,<br>`js‑graph.min.js`           | requires you to load the [Babel polyfill](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/polyfill/) yourself |
| `js‑graph.full.js`,<br>`js‑graph.full.min.js` | already includes the Babel polyfill                                                         |

If you don't know which you need, you probably want `js-graph.full.min.js`, because it will work out-of-the-box.
But it is generally more elegant to load the polyfill yourself, especially if you use other libraries that also
depend on it.
